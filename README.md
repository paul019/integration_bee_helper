## What?

- An <b>Integration Bee</b> is a fun competition amongst students to find out who is best in solving integrals. Usually, it is hosted in a big lecture hall with hundreds of spectators.
- The competition format was initially invented at the MIT, but soon adopted at many universities around the world – amongst others [in Heidelberg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPV4zvshbvQ&t=9737s).
- The <b>Integration Bee Helper</b> (this software) can help the organizers of such a competition to plan and carry out the event.
- However, the software might be suitable for a wide range of exercise-based competition formats. (How about an IUPAC naming competition for chemistry students? ;-))
